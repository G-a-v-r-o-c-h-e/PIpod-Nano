# PIpod-Nano

A DIY Ipod nano lookalike involving a raspberry pi zero. 
The hardware I am currently using is :
 - Raspberry pi zero v1.3
 - [Pirate Audio Headphone Amp](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pirate-audio-headphone-amp)
 - [UPS Lite v1.2](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32954180664.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.40de6c37VWMT3f)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your pi.
